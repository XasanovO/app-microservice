**Microservices Learning Project**

This repository contains my personal 
code and projects as I learn and 
implement microservices using 
Spring Boot. It serves as a practical 
exploration of microservices architecture, including:

- **Parent POM Management**: Used a single parent POM (pom.xml) to manage dependencies and build configurations for all microservices.
- **Eureka Service Discovery**: Implemented Eureka for service registration and discovery, allowing microservices to locate each other.
- **API Gateway**: Set up an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to appropriate microservices, providing a single entry point.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Used OpenFeign for declarative REST client creation, enabling seamless communication between microservices.
- **Messaging with RabbitMQ**: Integrated RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between services, enhancing scalability and decoupling.
- **Spring Boot**: Leveraged Spring Boot to build and deploy microservices efficiently, utilizing its extensive ecosystem and features.

Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud Eureka**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **OpenFeign**
- **RabbitMQ**

This repository is intended for my own learning and testing 
purposes as I explore and implement various 
aspects of microservices architecture using Spring Boot.
